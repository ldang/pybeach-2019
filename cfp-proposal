# Protected Python: It's time we had 'the talk'

## Elevator Pitch

Today, developers and users of Python need to be aware of cybersecurity principles more
than ever before.  In this talk, we'll go over some of the biggest issues that
developers face as vulnerabilities and how to protect against them.

## Description

In this talk we'll go over some of the major issue they face when it comes to developing
Python application and cybersecurity principals.  These may include:

* typo squatting of pip packages
* using the `eval` function on untrusted code
* using untrusted `pickle`'d data
* using old/outdated packages

Additionally we'll cover different ways to protect yourself from these attacks:

* checking signed packages
* using package managers such as conda to keep packages updated
* using the package `safety` to run checks
* make sure the package you're installing is the correct package

## Notes

I work at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a Software Assurance Engineer where I work
with a team of other engineers in identifying and assuring different aspects of
cybersecurity practices and principles.
